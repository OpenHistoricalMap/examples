This directory contains examples of leaflet/jquery/overpass code to
mashup OSM & OHM data with either OSM or MapBox Satellite providing
a base layer, and html to display selected example maps.

There are currently two different approaches to the OSM/OHM mashup
represented here.

leaflet/OHMembed.js

this simply overlays OHM tiles on OSM tiles or MapBox Satellite
tiles. A control allows the opacity of the OHM tile to be adjusted.
Examples of its use are test/StJohns.html and test/BeeLine.html

leaflet/OHM-rt-v3.js

this provides a choice of OSM tiles or MapBox Satellite tiles as
a basemap. Race track data may be fetched from OHM and/or OSM
as GeoJSON, and it is overlayed on the basemap as a set of GeoJSON
layers, one for each relation of type=circuit and one for any
highway=raceway ways that are not part of a circuit relation.
